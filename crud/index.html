			Full title: participation trophies with No Secure Disposition ordered by Agreeableness [MM/DD|2X]

			- Cover art by eileen m. butler
			
			- Tracks curated and truncated from much longer live-mixing sessions by eileen m. butler on a linux box.
				
			- All sounds made w/ Ableton, puredata, and a Casio CT-670 unless otherwise specified (third-party sources listed in liner-notes.txt file).
			
			- Tracks 1-3, and 6-13 are almost entirely unmastered, tracks 4 and 5 had certain high frequencies reduced (within a range of 2-3dB or so) via dynamic EQ.
			
			- All titles are formatted with specific intent and purpose.

			personal request from e.m.b.: I would greatly appreciate if my music didn't get reuploaded to other proprietary distribution platforms (such as youtube/soundcloud/spotify/etc) by third parties.
			You're not helping by doing this, but I won't issue takedowns or anything.
			If you're a writer that wants to cover my music, just link to this site.</p>
